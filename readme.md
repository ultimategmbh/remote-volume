# Remote Volume

This small Electron application enables you to control the OS audio volume over a WebSocket connection.

## Features

- Get, set, increase or decrease the audio volume
- Get, mute, unmute or toggle the mute state of the audio volume
- Get the current audio output device

The application has an built in feature to poll the system audio values (volume and mute state) - this can be enabled or disabled in the configuration window (you can also define a polling interval).
As soon as something changes, the updated values will be sent out to all connected WebSocket clients.

## Supported OS

- Windows Vista or later
- OSX on Arm & x64
- Linux\*

\*No autostart possible by the software setting - needs to be solved manually!

## Installation

Navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/leonreucher/remote-volume/releases/latest) and download the corresponding file for your OS. Mac OS users will find a .dmg volume, containing the application. Windows users will find a .exe file which contains an installer.
Linux users will find a .deb file for installation.

## Setup

After installing the application, it will run as a menu bar application. By clicking on the menu bar item, you can either close the application or open the configuration screen.

Inside the configuration screen, you can

- select the port, on which clients can connect to the WebSocket server.
- enable or disable the polling feature and set a polling interval.
- select, wether the application should auto start together with the system.
